    \name{MARIA WYRZYKOWSKA}
\tagline{STUDENT }

\personalinfo{%
    I am a first-year student of Master's Degree in Computer Science at University of Wrocław. I have first IT-related experiences in both multicultural corporate, fast-paced startup and academic environments. I am looking for more opportunities to further enhance and make use of my skills solving real-life problems. My interests mainly revolve around various applications of Data Science and Machine Learning, from recommender systems, through robotics, to drug discovery.  
    Being a fast learner open for new challenges makes me more than eager to get to know new tools and programming languages.
